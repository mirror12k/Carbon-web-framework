Graphite v0.3 specification
	lightly inspired by Meteor's SpaceBars

	this document only specifies how Graphite code should be formatted, what the Graphite code should ultimately output, and how
	the runtime api of Graphite should work in perl. details about how and into what the Graphite code should be compiled are left up to
	the implementations.


what is Graphite?
	Graphite is a templating language engine with a plugin for Anthracite which compiles Graphite templating language into perl code
	for use in Anthracite. Simple and straight forward to use.

	dynamic files containing graphite code should be pre-compiled and your templates should all be pre-included to maximise 
	performance. this way the overhead of using templates is simply the cost of executing raw perl code that has already been compiled

Graphite templating language specification:

	Graphite blocks are directive blocks that start with '<?graphite' and end with '?>' or the end of the file if no '?>' is found
	these blocks may contain html tags inside but no directive tags

	words starting with a '#' are instructions to use an existing helper and any data between it and the '#/' ending it are passed to the helper

	declaring a template:
		the 'template' helper creates a new template of the given text, the first word specified indicates the name of the template:
			#template template_name
				hello world!
			#/
		template names may include a '::' to indicate a template namespace for better organization
		#template my_mod::my_temp
			<p>this is the template data</p>
		#/

	template variables:

		templates are allows to take data passed in and render it (it will automatically escapped with htmlentities):
			#template argy_template
				<h1>$title</h1>
			#/
		any variables referred to by '$<name>' will automatically hash dereference the default variable '$_'
		templates can also string the default variable directly instead of dereferencing it:
			#template bold_text
				<h1>$_</h1>
			#/

	template inclusion:

		templates can invoke other templates with or without arguments to render it inside by using '@:'
			#template invokes_another
				@template_name
			#/

		using an arrow, you can pass a variable argument or a single constant which becomes the default variable for the template
			#template invokes_with_data
				@bold_text->$my_title
				@bold_text->'hello world'
			#/

		to pass more data, square brackets can be used to pass an array reference of values,
		or curly brackets to pass a hash reference with the given keys
			#template invokes_complex
				@my_list_creator->[$my_mod, 'limestone', 'graphite']
				@complex_include->{arg1 => 'asdf', arg2 => $title, arg3 => $_}
			#/
		these values may be regular values or deeper hash or array references:
			#template invokes_super_complex
				@my_list_creator->[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],{ user => 'user', pass => 'ssap' }]
				@complex_include->{
					available => {
						john => 'yes',
						joe => 'yes',
						johnson => 'no'
					},
					jobs => [
						'order pizza',
						'pay for pizza',
						'eat pizza'
					]
				}
			#/


	variable template inclusion:
		to include a template from a variable simply use '@$' instead of '@', then the variable name:
			#template dynamic_include
				@$_->'hello world!'
			#/
		arguments can be passed or omitted the same as regular inclusion

		to pass a named template as an argument to another template, simply refer to it with '@':
			#template invokes_with_template
				@dynamic_include->@bold_text
				@another_dynamic_include->[@bold_text, @my_mod::my_temp]
				@yet_another_dynamic_include->{ lambda => @bold_text, texter => @my_mod::my_temp }
			#/


	adding html and text to the html document:

		any text and html outside of the document will be directly written to output
		any templates included outside of a template directive will be executed and their output will be sent to echo


	Graphite comments:
		comment blocks can be written by starting and ending them with '###':
			#template magic
				###
					this is my template
					it writes the word 'heading' in big bold letters
					copyright trademark copyleft tariff-exempt
				###
				<h1>heading</h1>
			#/

	helper inclusion:

		other helpers can be invoked inside a template declaration:
			#template my_list_creator
				#foreach $items
					<li>$_</li>
				#/
			#/
		they can return text or code which will be included as part of the template


	other built-in helpers:
		the 'foreach' helper takes an array ref variable argument and executes it's internal block for each item in the array reference,
		setting '$_' to the current value of the iterator
			#foreach $_
				<p>i got a string: $_</p>
			#/

			#foreach $experiences
				<li> previous experience: $_ </p>
			#/

		the 'if' helper evals a given expression in parenthesis and executes the inside block only if the expression returns something truthy
			#if ($name eq 'john')
				hello there john!
			#/
		the 'if' helper sets the engine's else condition when executed
		specifically, it sets the else condition to true if it executed its block, and false if it didn't
		the 'else' helper reads the else condition and executes if it is true
			#if ('asdf' eq 'qwerty')
				will never be seen
			#/
			#else
				will always be seen
			#/
		additionally, the 'elsif' helper also reads the else condition and evals its expression if the else condition is met
		it sets the else condition to false only it the else condition was previously true and its expression evaluated to true,
		otherwise it sets the else condition to true
			#if ('asdf' eq 'qwerty')
				never seen
			#/
			#elsif ('asdf' eq lc 'ASDF')
				always seen!
			#/
			#else
				never seen again!
			#/
		the 'with' helper sets the default variable to the given value:
			#with $parent
				name: $name
				age: $age
			#/
		the 'namespace' helper makes any templates declared or invoked inside it's body be namespaced to the given namespace
			#namespace GraphiteBars
				#template header
					<!doctype>
					<html>
					<title>
				#/
			#/
			@GraphiteBars::header
		namespace declarations stack on one another, so declaring a namespace 'tools' inside of a namespace 'awesome' will
		result in the namespace being 'awesome::tools'
		note: the 'namespace' helper does not edit any text of the template declation or invokation, instead it sets the Graphite engine's current namespace value

		the 'warn' helper writes any output from its block to the $runtime->warn method which should spit it out to stderr
			#if (not defined $_)
				#warn
					not defined argument passed to template
				#/
			#/

		the 'die' helper works similar to the 'warn' helper only it calls $runtime->die instead of warn which will stop data from being sent to the client
		as well as sending output to stderr
			#if (not defined $_)
				#die
					argument MUST be defined
				#/
			#/



	programmable helpers:
		additional helpers can be defined programmatically
		helpers can edit the environment, be sure to view the helper's documentation

		if a template or document ever needs more logic than just a few ifs, the logic should go in a helper, or better yet, be placed in code somewhere else

runtime API specification:
	template objects:
		each template is stored as Carbon::Graphite::Template objects within the Graphite engine
		they are accessible with get_template of the Graphite plugin:
			my $template = $graphite->get_template('template_name')

		to set a template by name:
			$graphite->set_template('template_name' => $template)

		they can be individually rendered by calling render_template of the Graphite plugin:
			echo $graphite->render_template('template_name')
		either the name of a template, or a template object may be passed
		an argument can be passed to act as the default variable in the template:
			echo $graphite->render_template(bold_text => 'hello world!')
			echo $graphite->render_template(some_template => [ qw/ a list of strings/ ])
			echo $graphite->render_template(some_template => { type => 'hash ref', explanation => 'arugments to templates' })

	helper objects:
		helpers are stored as Carbon::Graphite::Helper objects within the Graphite engine
		helpers can be accessed or created by name:
			my $helper = $graphite->get_helper('foreach')
			$graphite->set_helper(awesomness => Carbon::Graphite::Helper->new(sub {
				# helper code
			}))
		the subroutine passed to Carbon::Graphite::Helper will receive 3 arguments;
		the helper object itself, the Graphite engine, and the text inside the helper
		the helper must return code (or at least an empty string) which will be appended in the location it was called
			my $helper = Carbon::Graphite::Helper->new(sub {
				my ($helper, $engine, $text) = @_;
				...
				return "warn 'hello world!';"
			});
		to send data to output, simply append to the '$output' variable inside the returned code:
			return "$output .= 'my special text';"
		the helper may edit the text it received in order to parse parameters
		the helper MUST not edit text inside of a helper call which is nested inside of it
			#my_helper my_arg
				this part can be edited
				#with $var
					this part must not be edited by the 'my_helper' helper function
				#/
			#/
		it can then pass the text to '$engine->compile_graphite' in order to compile it as proper Graphite code
		code can access template variables by using the '$arg' variable or dereferencing it as whatever is necessary:
			$output .= sha256_hex $arg->{super_secret};
