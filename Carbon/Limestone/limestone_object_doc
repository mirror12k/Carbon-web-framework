this document specifies the interface of Limestone database objects


database objects are abstractions that allow a common interface to the Limestone server and client
each database object must implement the following api:
	$obj->create($filepath, $data)
		creates a new database object, with the given directory as its private location for storing data
		it is also given a $data object which refers to the data passed along with the creation request
	$obj->load($filepath)
		creates a new object with data from the already stored files in the given directory
	$obj->query($query)
		gives the Carbon::Limestone::Query to the object for parsing and processing, awaiting a return of a Carbon::Limestone::Result
	$obj->store
		tells the object to store all of its data on disk due to to server shutdown or similar
	$obj->delete
		tells the object to delete all of its data and itself
	$obj->client
		returns a hash reference, with the 'package' key pointing to a string package name referring to the package that will be used client side
		client package must implement a ->new method which takes the arguments of a limestone connection object and a database object name
		additionally the hash reference returned by ->client may have a 'data' key which will be passed as the third argument to the client's ->new method
		the rest of the client interface is up to implementation as different database objects may have very different modes of operation

the Carbon::Limestone::Database will handle the loading and storing of objects on startup/shutdown,
as well as organizing the objects by unique names and creating and destroying objects when requested by queries

each object should be completely shared to allow the database to access it in multi-threaded context

it's the object's responsibility to securely synchronize any reads/writes when necessary
	further it must keep track of it's access state, as a delete operation can be called before a query has completed
